This portfolio has been rewritten in TypeScript, revamped with responsiveness & accessibility in mind, and to try out some new libraries.

Changes from V2.0:

- 🏙️ TypeScript
- 🔍 Search bar, powered by Fuse.js
- ⌨️ Keyboard navigation
- 🗞️ Added a certificates section under about
- 😎 Updated with the latest trendy UI libraries (shadcn, tailwindcss, vite)
- 🐛 Fixed some jittering bugs, like in the Experience section
